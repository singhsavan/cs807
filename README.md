CITY_APP

Project Title:
Meteor app to find nearest food places in a arequested area

Introduction:
The main idea behind building this project is to use meteor as a platform and utilize the 
relevant api and javascript packages that can be integrated with cloud services.
We wanted to make Google API talk to cloud services. Metor provides services that can be integrated with various API and javascript packages.
This Application would show nearest places in a designated region. In the earlier stages we would try and show nearby food places.
The food places can be entered in the database and would be shown on the google map.


API used:
